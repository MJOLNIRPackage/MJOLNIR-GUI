The Gui is split into two main parts: the upper concering data files and sets, and the lower, which concers data plotting and visualization.

Simple start:
- To start, create a new DataSet by clicking the highlighted button in the top left corner.
- Add data files by clicking the highlighted data file button in the top center.
- The added files can be converted by pressing the convert button.
- When all of the above steps have successfully been followed plots can now be generated.


Instead of going through the hoops described above, save the gui state into a file by entering files>Save GUI state or ctrl+s. This file can then later be loaded. Notice that this file does not contain the data, but only a description of the file location and conversion.
